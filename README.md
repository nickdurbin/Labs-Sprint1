- How did these conversations determine the features you will deliver during Labs?
- How did your discussions change the way you viewed the product?

### Prompt 2

Describe the technical or design discussions that shaped the long-term product vision.

- **For data scientists and engineers:** Describe the technologies that you will use to build this product. Why do they fit the product vision?
